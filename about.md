<h4>Shunsuke Kasahara</h4>
<p>I am a Mechanical Engineer, currently pursuing B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at New York University Abu Dhabi. Building things has always been my passion since kindergarten, and I strive to design and build cool things. My main interests are product design, mechanical design and manufacturing. Before coming to NYU Abu Dhabi, I studied at Nishiyamato Gakuen High School in Nara, Japan.
