    Different shapes were considered, so that it can be held comfortably and operated accurately even with gloves on. Many kinds of materials were researched and experimented. Wood was chosen as the material for the final version, so that a user can develop an emotional connection to this bricolage radio overtime.

    Extensive research was conducted from typical timeline in mountaineering to mountaineering philosophy, and existing mountaineering gears in the market. From this research, four requirements as a mountaineering gear were selected: small, simple, durable and light. A rope was found to fulfill all four requirements, and to communicate the idea, Moodboard was created.

    The radio was design to contain nothing but four screws protruding from its surface, which are connected to an antenna wire – referring to the idea of a rope. The antenna wire can be connected to other conducting mountaineering equipment such as trekking pole, tent pole, cutlery, or ice axe, as an extension. This idea comes from the mountaineering mindset to make use of everything one brings to the mountain. One can catch weak signals high up in the mountains, without having to carry big and heavy antenna.

    For an engineering elective course, "Design Fundamentals for Engineers (ENGR-AD 323)" at NYU Abu Dhabi, students were challenged to develop a bricolage radio (intended for small number production). In the ideation process, target group was set to mountaineers who use radio to gain weather information in the mountains.
