    <p>An experimental chimney has been designed and built in conjunction with experts from Kumbharwada, facilitators from urbz, and NYU Abu Dhabi. This design helps reduce local commuinty's exposure to smoke. With the addition of a wet scrubbing system, there is a possibility to filter particulate matter from the released smoke and potentially further lower the level of pollution released in the broader area.</p>
