    Developed a cost effective and easy to maintain filtering system to manage air pollution resulting from firing kilns in the potters community of Mumbai. Modeled and built a chimney that assists in reducing the communityâ€™s exposure to noxious fumes, while the integrated wet scrubbing system filters the smoke, leading to lower levels of pollution in the area.
